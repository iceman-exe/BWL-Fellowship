What are Firewalls:

Firewall:

    • Network device to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
    • Acts like a barrier/wall between private/trusted network and external/public networks.


Deployment types:

    • Host based:
            ▪ These are deployed on end machines. Most operating systems provide built-in firewall functionality. Host based firewalls are software based.

    • Network based:
            ▪ These scan entire networks. Usually organisations will deploy network based firewalls on dedicated hardware, however they can also be deployed on shared hardware. Dedicated hardware is better for performance at scale.


Filtering types:

    • Packet filtering firewall/layer 4 firewall:
            ▪ Checks IP address, port no, from IP and TCP headers
            ▪ Works are network and transport layers
            ▪ Can block IP addresses and entire networks
            ▪ Can block services such as http, ftp etc.

    • Application/proxy firewall
