EIGRP Black Hole Network:

Routing protocols are easy to hack. It is necessary to configure them correctly or they will be vulnerable to attacks.

Fake routes can be sent to an improperly configured router and added to its routing table allowing traffic to be re-directed anywhere else.

Black Holes in a Network:

    • Places in a network where traffic is silently discarded without informing the source that the data did not reach the intended recipient so the sender keeps sending traffic.
      
    • Black holes can only be detected by monitoring the lost traffic.
      
    • The most common form of black hole is an IP address that specifies a host machine that is not running or an address to which no host has been assigned. Even though TCP/IP provides a means of communicating the delivery failure back to the sender via ICMP, traffic destined for such addresses is often just dropped. A dead address will be undetectable only to protocols that are both connection-less and unreliable (e.g. UDP). Connection-oriented or reliable protocols (TCP, RUDP) will either fail to connect to a dead address or will fail to receive expected acknowledgements.
