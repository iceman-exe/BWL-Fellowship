Footprinting and Nmap

Footprinting:

    • Footprinting refers to the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities/organisations they belong to.
    • Footprinting involves the use of various tools and technologies to collect information.
    • The information is collected during reconnaissance phase and can be very useful.
    • Some of the tools used for footprinting are:
            ▪ Sam Spade
            ▪ nslookup
            ▪ traceroute
            ▪ Nmap
            ▪ neotrace

    • Some of the techniques used for footprinting are:
            ▪ DNS queries
            ▪ Network enumeration
            ▪ Network queries
            ▪ Operating system identification

Nmap:

    • Short for Network Mapper.
    • A network scanner tool used to discover hosts and services on a network by sending packets and analysing the responses.
    • Nmap is able to adapt to network conditions such as latency and congestion.
    • Nmap’s features include:
            ▪ Host discovery on the network
            ▪ Port scanning and enumerating open ports on target hosts
            ▪ Version detection
            ▪ Operating system and hardware detection based on network activity
            ▪ Reverse DNS
            ▪ Device type detection
            ▪ MAC address detection
