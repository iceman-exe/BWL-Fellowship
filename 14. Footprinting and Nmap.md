Footprinting and Nmap

Footprinting:

    • Footprinting refers to the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities/organisations they belong to.
    • Footprinting involves the use of various tools and technologies to collect information.
    • The information is collected during reconnaissance phase and can be very useful.
    • Some of the tools used for footprinting are:
            ▪ Sam Spade
            ▪ nslookup
            ▪ traceroute
            ▪ Nmap
            ▪ neotrace

    • Some of the techniques used for footprinting are:
            ▪ DNS queries
            ▪ Network enumeration
            ▪ Network queries
            ▪ Operating system identification

Nmap:

    • Short for Network Mapper.
    • A network scanner tool used to discover hosts and services on a network by sending packets and analysing the responses.
    • Nmap is able to adapt to network conditions such as latency and congestion.
    • Nmap’s features include:
            ▪ Host discovery on the network
            ▪ Port scanning and enumerating open ports on target hosts
            ▪ Version detection
            ▪ Operating system and hardware detection based on network activity
            ▪ Reverse DNS
            ▪ Device type detection
            ▪ MAC address detection

      
    • Nmap scans for 1000 ports by default. This can be changed by providing a specific port or port range to scan or by scanning all ports.
    • Some nmap options are: 
            ▪ -v for verbose output, -vv for extra verbose output 
            ▪ -oG for grep-able output
            ▪ IP ranges/ subnet ranges can be scanned by passing an IP address with the range specified e.g. nmap 192.168.1-67.0, nmap 192.168.1.0-255
            ▪ -p to pass port or port range to scan. DO NOT scan all ports or even 1000 ports. It will take a lot of time and might trigger website protection measures.
            ▪ In order to perform a full nmap scan on only the open ports within the local subnet the commands will be(in order):
                • nmap -oG 192.168.1.0-255 -p 22 -vv > /home/scanResults
                • cat scanResults | grep Up | awk -F " " '{print $2}' > scanOpen
                • nmap -iL scanOpen
